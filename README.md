<h2 align="center">About The Project</h2>

<h4>
Welcome to our version of social-network Project!

 where we have to create a Facebook-like social network with features such as followers, profiles, posts, groups, notifications, and chats. This project involves both frontend and backend development using a JavaScript framework for the client side and Go for the server side. The backend handles user authentication, image management, WebSocket connections for real-time chats, and uses PostgreSQL for data storage with Docker containers for deployment.
